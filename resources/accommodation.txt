<h2> Home stay </h2>
Korea's home-stay programs are distinguished in many ways from those of other countries
First, most Korean hosts apply for this program to find out more about foreign cultures rather than simply for commercial purposes. Foreign visitors naturally benefit from wonderful amenities at very affordable prices. Your hosts will serve hearty home dishes and will be happy to direct you wherever you want to go for sightseeing, cultural events, shopping and more
Those from other lands who want to experience the lifestyle and the legendary hospitality of the Korean home should not hesitate to get in touch with Korean home-stay organisation.
